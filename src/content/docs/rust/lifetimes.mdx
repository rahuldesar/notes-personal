- Every Reference has a **Lifetime**
- Lifetime Annotations - `'x`
  - &i32
  - &'a i32
  - &'a mut i32

## Lifetime in Function

```rs
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str { todo!() }
```

- The function signature tells Rust that for some lifetime 'a, the function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as long as lifetime 'a.
- The function signature also tells Rust that the string slice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime 'a.
- In practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the longest function is the same as the **smaller** of the lifetimes of the values referred to by the function arguments.

## Lifetimes in Struct Definition

```rs
struct StructWithLifetime<'a> {
    str_slice_test: &'a str,
    int_test: &'a i32,
}
```

## Lifetime Elision

- Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called input lifetimes, and lifetimes on return values are called output lifetimes.

### Rules for Lifetime Elision

Three rules to figure out the lifetimes, first applies to input lifetime, second and third is applied to output lifetime

  1. Compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each parameter thatâ€™s a reference.

     - One Parameter

     ```rs
     fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)
     ```

     - Two Parameter

     ```rs
     fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32)
     ```

  2. If there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters:

  ```rs
  fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.
  ```

  3. If there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.

## Lifetimes in Method Definition

```rs
impl<'a> StructWithLifetime<'a> {}
```

## Static Lifetime
