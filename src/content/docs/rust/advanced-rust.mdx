## Unsafe Rust
### Unsafe Superpowers

- Dereference a raw pointer
  - raw pointers can be immutable or mutable and are written as *const T and *mut T, respectively
- Call an unsafe function or method
  - `unsafe` function has requirements we need to uphold and Rust can’t guarantee we’ve met these requirements

  ```rs 
      unsafe fn dangerous() {} // unsafe function

      unsafe {
          dangerous();         // usage
      }

  ```
- Access or modify a mutable static variable
- Implement an unsafe trait
- Access fields of unions


:::note
Unsafe Rust doesn't turn off the borrow checker, or disable any rust safety checks.
