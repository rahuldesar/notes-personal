This chapter walks you through the nuts and bolts of TypeScript’s type system: how to
think about it, how to use it, choices you’ll need to make, and features you should
avoid.

### **6: Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System**

:::note
When you install TypeScript, you get two executables:

1. `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler
2. `tsserver`, the TypeScript standalone server

:::

- Take advantage of the TypeScript language services by using an editor that can use them.
- Use your editor to build an intuition for how the type system works and how TypeScript infers types.
- Know how to jump into type declaration files to see how they model behavior.

### **7: Think of Types as Sets of Values**

### **8: Know How to Tell Whether a Symbol Is in the Type Space or Value Space**

### **9: Prefer Type Declarations to Type Assertions**

### **10: Avoid Object Wrapper Types (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, BigInt)**

### **11: Recognize the Limits of Excess Property Checking**

### **12: Apply Types to Entire Function Expressions When Possible**

### **13: Know the Differences Between type and interface**

### **14: Use Type Operations and Generics to Avoid Repeating Yourself**

### **15: Use Index Signatures for Dynamic Data**

### **16: Prefer Arrays, Tuples, and ArrayLike to number Index Signatures**

### **17: Use readonly to Avoid Errors Associated with Mutation**

### **18: Use Mapped Types to Keep Values in Sync**
