This chapter walks you through the nuts and bolts of TypeScript’s type system: how to
think about it, how to use it, choices you’ll need to make, and features you should
avoid.

### **6: Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System**

:::note
When you install TypeScript, you get two executables:

1. `tsc`, the TypeScript compiler
2. `tsserver`, the TypeScript standalone server

:::

- Take advantage of the TypeScript language services by using an editor that can use them.
- Use your editor to build an intuition for how the type system works and how TypeScript infers types.
- Know how to jump into type declaration files to see how they model behavior.

### **7: Think of Types as Sets of Values**

:::caution

:::

- Think of types as sets of values (the type’s domain). These sets can either be finite (e.g., boolean or literal types) or infinite (e.g., number or string).
- TypeScript types form intersecting sets (a Venn diagram) rather than a strict hierarchy. Two types can overlap without either being a subtype of the other.
- Remember that an object can still belong to a type even if it has additional properties that were not mentioned in the type declaration.
- Type operations apply to a set’s domain. The intersection of A and B is the intersection of A’s domain and B’s domain. For object types, this means that values in A & B have the properties of both A and B.
- Think of “extends,” “assignable to,” and “subtype of ” as synonyms for “subset of.”

### **8: Know How to Tell Whether a Symbol Is in the Type Space or Value Space**

:::note
A symbol in TypeScript exists in one of two spaces:

- Type space
- Value space

:::

- Know how to tell whether you’re in type space or value space while reading a
  TypeScript expression. Use the TypeScript playground to build an intuition for
  this.
- Every value has a type, but types do not have values. Constructs such as type and
  interface exist only in the type space.
- "foo" might be a string literal, or it might be a string literal type. Be aware of this
  distinction and understand how to tell which it is.
- `typeof`, `this`, and many other operators and keywords have different meanings
  in type space and value space.
- Some constructs such as `class` or `enum` introduce both a type and a value.

### **9: Prefer Type Declarations to Type Assertions**

- Prefer type declarations (: Type) to type assertions (as Type).
- Know how to annotate the return type of an arrow function.

  :::note
  It’s not always clear how to use a declaration with arrow functions. A more concise
  way is to declare the return type of the arrow function.

  ```js
  interface Person { name: string };

  const people = ['alice', 'bob', 'jan'].map(
  (name): Person => ({name})
  ); // Type is Person[]
  ```

  The parentheses are significant here!
  `(name: Person)` is different than `(name): Person`

  :::

- Use type assertions and non-null assertions when you know something about
  types that TypeScript does not.

### **10: Avoid Object Wrapper Types (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, BigInt)**

- Understand how object wrapper types are used to provide methods on primitive values. Avoid instantiating them or using them directly.
- Avoid TypeScript object wrapper types. Use the primitive types instead: string instead of String, number instead of Number, boolean instead of Boolean, symbol instead of Symbol, and bigint instead of BigInt.

### **11: Recognize the Limits of Excess Property Checking**

- When you assign an object literal to a variable or pass it as an argument to a
  function, it undergoes excess property checking.
- Excess property checking is an effective way to find errors, but it is distinct from
  the usual structural assignability checks done by the TypeScript type checker.
  Conflating these processes will make it harder for you to build a mental model of
  assignability.
- Be aware of the limits of excess property checking: introducing an intermediate
  variable will remove these checks.

### **12: Apply Types to Entire Function Expressions When Possible**

- Consider applying type annotations to entire function expressions, rather than to their parameters and return type.
- If you’re writing the same type signature repeatedly, factor out a function type or look for an existing one. If you’re a library author, provide types for common callbacks.
- Use `typeof fn` to match the signature of another function.

### **13: Know the Differences Between type and interface**

- Understand the differences and similarities between `type` and `interface`.
- Know how to write the same types using either syntax.
- In deciding which to use in your project, consider the established style and whether augmentation might be beneficial.

### **14: Use Type Operations and Generics to Avoid Repeating Yourself**

- The DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principle applies to types as much as it applies to logic.
- Name types rather than repeating them. Use extends to avoid repeating fields in interfaces.
- Build an understanding of the tools provided by TypeScript to map between types. These include keyof, typeof, indexing, and mapped types.
- Generic types are the equivalent of functions for types. Use them to map between types instead of repeating types. Use `extends` to constrain generic types.
- Familiarize yourself with generic types defined in the standard library such as `Pick`, `Partial`, and `ReturnType`.

### **15: Use Index Signatures for Dynamic Data**

- Use `index signatures` when the properties of an object cannot be known until runtime—for example, if you’re loading them from a CSV file.
- Consider adding `undefined` to the value type of an `index signature` for safer access.
- Prefer more precise types to index signatures when possible: `interfaces`, `Records`, or mapped types.

### **16: Prefer Arrays, Tuples, and ArrayLike to number Index Signatures**

- Understand that arrays are objects, so their keys are strings, not numbers. number as an `index signature` is a purely TypeScript construct which is designed to help catch bugs.
- Prefer `Array`, `tuple`, or `ArrayLike` types to using number in an index signature yourself.

### **17: Use readonly to Avoid Errors Associated with Mutation**

- If your function does not modify its parameters then declare them readonly. This makes its contract clearer and prevents inadvertent mutations in its implementation.
- Use `readonly` to prevent errors with mutation and to find the places in your code where mutations occur.
- Understand the difference between `const` and `readonly`.
- Understand that `readonly` is shallow.

### **18: Use Mapped Types to Keep Values in Sync**

- Use mapped types to keep related values and types synchronized.
- Consider using mapped types to force choices when adding new properties to an interface.
