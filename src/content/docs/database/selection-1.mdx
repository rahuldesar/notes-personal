## Basis SQL Query Syntax

`SELECT` operator: get data samples from DBMS.

Output of all data from the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table_name
```

Output of data from certain columns of the table

```sql
SELECT Table_field1, Table_field2, ... FROM Table_name
```

**Aliases**: In case we want to output some columns of the table.

```sql
SELECT Table_field1, Table_field2 AS alias FROM Table_name
```

OUTPUT:

| Table_field1 | alias  |
| ------------ | ------ |
| data_1       | data_2 |

### Literals

A literal is an explicitly specified fixed value, such as the number 12 or the string `"SQL"'.

The main types of literals in MySQL are:

- string
- numeric
- logical
- NULL
- date and time literal

#### String Literals

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (') or double (") quotation marks. For example, this is a string" and `"this is a string"`.

Strings can contain special sequences of characters starting with `"\"`.

```sql
SELECT "Line \n Another line" as String
```

#### Numeric Literals

Numeric literals can have

- Integers and floating point : `1`, `2.8`, `0.01`
- Only integer part, fractional part or both: `.2`, `1.2`, `20`
- Positive or negative numbers: `+1`, `-10`, `-2.2`
- Exponential notation: `1e3`, `1e-3`

#### Arithemetic Operators

For numeric literals, SQL has all arithimetic Operators

- %, MOD
  = \*
- -
- -
- /
- DIV

USAGE

```sql
SELECT (5 * 2 - 6) / 2 AS Result;

```

#### Date and Time literals.

- Date and time values can be represented as string or numbers.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table_name WHERE birthday > '1970-12-30'
```

where `1970-12-30` is a string.

#### Logical Literals

A logical literal is a value of `TRUE` or `FALSE`

#### NULL

The value `NULL` means "no data" or "no value."

### Function usage

When creating SQL queries, we can use built-in functions. For example, if we want to output a string in uppercase, we can use the `UPPER` function.

```sql
SELECT UPPER("Hello world")
```

[**functions reference page**](https://sql-academy.org/handbook/SUBSTRING)

#### Applying functions over table field values

Functions can be used not only on literals, but also on values taken from a table.

```sql
SELECT member_name,
	LENGTH(member_name) AS fullname_length
FROM FamilyMembers;
```

#### Operations on the result of the function

Since we know that each function must return any of the possible literals, its result can also be used in further calculations and transformations.

```sql
SELECT UPPER(LEFT('sql-academy', 3)) AS str;
```

### Duplication elimination, DISTINCT

In some situations, an SQL query for selecting data may return duplicate rows. To avoid such duplication when selecting data, there is the `DISTINCT` operator.

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] table_fields FROM table_name;
```

## Conditional WHERE operator

The situation where a selection needs to be made based on a specific condition is very common. For this, the `WHERE` operator exists in the `SELECT` statement, which is followed by conditions for limiting rows.

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT] table_fields FROM table_name
WHERE row_limit_conditions
[logical_operator other_row_limit_conditions];
```

### Operators

#### Comparision Operators

```sql
SELECT
  2 = 1 as Numerical_equality_test,
	'a' = 'a' as String_equality_test,
	NULL <=> NULL as Equivalence_test,
	2 <> 2 as Inequality_test,
	3 < 4 as Less_than_test,
	10 <= 10 as Less_than_or_equal_test,
	7 > 1  as Greater_than_test,
	8 >= 10 as Greater_than_or_equal_test;
```

#### Logical Operators

- `NOT`
- `OR`
- `AND`
- `XOR`

### Operators IS NULL, BETWEEN, IN

#### IS NULL

The `IS NULL` operator allows you to find out if the checked value is equal to `NULL`, i.e. if the value is empty.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Teacher
WHERE middle_name IS NULL;
```

#### BETWEEN

The `BETWEEN` `min AND max` operator allows you to find out if the checked value of the column is located in the interval between `min` and `max`, including the values `min` and `max` themselves

```sql
SELECT * FROM Payments
WHERE unit_price BETWEEN 100 AND 500;
```

is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Payments
WHERE unit_price >= 100 AND unit_price <= 500;
```

#### IN

The `IN` operator allows you to find out if the checked value of the column is included in a list of certain values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM FamilyMembers
WHERE status IN ('father', 'mother');
```

### Operators LIKE

The `LIKE` operator is used in conditional queries when we want to find out whether a string matches a certain pattern.

Syntax:

```
... WHERE table_field [NOT] LIKE string_pattern
```

Special characters

- `%` Any sequence of characters
- `-` Any single character

## Sorting, ORDER BY operator

## Grouping, GROUP BY operator

### Aggregate functions

### Operator HAVING
