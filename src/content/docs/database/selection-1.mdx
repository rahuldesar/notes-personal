## Basis SQL Query Syntax
`SELECT` operator: get data samples from DBMS.

Output of all data from the table: 
```
SELECT * FROM <TABLE_NAME>
```

Output of data from certain columns of the table

```
SELECT COLUMN_1, COLUMN_2, ... FROM <TABLE_NAME>
```

**Aliases**: In case we want to output some columns of the table.
```
SELECT COLUMN_1, COLUMN_2 AS alias FROM <TABLE_NAME>
```
OUTPUT: 

| COLUMN_1 | alias |
|----------|-------|
| data_1   | data_2 |

### Literals
A literal is an explicitly specified fixed value, such as the number 12 or the string `"SQL"'.

The main types of literals in MySQL are:

- string
- numeric
- logical
- NULL
- date and time literal

#### String Literals
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (') or double (") quotation marks. For example, this is a string" and `"this is a string"`.

Strings can contain special sequences of characters starting with `"\"`.

```sql
SELECT "Line \n Another line" as String
```

#### Numeric Literals
Numeric literals can have 

- Integers and floating point : `1`, `2.8`, `0.01`
- Only integer part, fractional part or both: `.2`, `1.2`, `20`
- Positive or negative numbers: `+1`, `-10`, `-2.2`
- Exponential notation: `1e3`, `1e-3`

#### Arithemetic Operators
For numeric literals, SQL has all arithimetic Operators

- %, MOD
= * 
- + 
- * 
- /
- DIV

USAGE

```sql
SELECT (5 * 2 - 6) / 2 AS Result;

```

#### Date and Time literals.
- Date and time values can be represented as string or numbers.

```sql
SELECT * FROM <TABLE_NAME> WHERE birthday > '1970-12-30'
```
where `1970-12-30` is a string.

#### Logical Literals
A logical literal is a value of `TRUE` or `FALSE`

#### NULL
The value `NULL` means "no data" or "no value."


### Function usage
When creating SQL queries, we can use built-in functions. For example, if we want to output a string in uppercase, we can use the `UPPER` function.

```sql
SELECT UPPER("Hello world")
```

[**functions reference page**](https://sql-academy.org/handbook/SUBSTRING)

#### Applying functions over table field values
Functions can be used not only on literals, but also on values taken from a table.

```sql
SELECT member_name,
	LENGTH(member_name) AS fullname_length
FROM FamilyMembers;
```

#### Operations on the result of the function
Since we know that each function must return any of the possible literals, its result can also be used in further calculations and transformations.

```sql
SELECT UPPER(LEFT('sql-academy', 3)) AS str;
```


### Duplication elimination, DISTINCT
## Conditional WHERE operator
### Operators IS NULL, BETWEEN, IN
### Operators LIKE 
## Sorting, ORDER BY operator
## Grouping, GROUP BY operator
### Aggregate functions
### Operator HAVING
